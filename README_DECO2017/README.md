>In Web App Prototype, I made some changes in the effects and layout based on Web App Pitch. In order to make the overall function more specific and appropriate, I have improved my mockup according to the previous comment and self-reflection. Meanwhile, I revisited the users' frustration and need which concluded in persona. Also during iterating and developing the design, I have researched many other study apps' functions and layouts.
>
>In the README file, I will explain the pages that have been iterated and improved. The remaining page (the Books page) will have the same functions and design as the mockup.
## Webpage
### Dashboard
![Prototype(left) and Mockup(right)](/Img/Dashboard.png)
>In the dashboard prototype, I rearranged the layout of the dashboard design so that users can see all the functions of the web more clearly and intuitively. I have improved the tasks part to better help users see the completion progress and status.
>
>Based on the previous persona I have added an activities section so that users can arrange their schedule the need to complete. 
>
>In addition, I inserted a calendar on the dashboard. If users want to query more current day arrangements, they can see more details by pressing the buttons below.
### Calendar

>The main function of the calendar page remains the same as the original mockup. I have changed some of its auxiliary functions. On this page, users can arrange their own time planning for the day and add new activities in the schedule section.
>
>I added task progress so users can check the monthly completion progress of each course.
### Timer

> On this page, I have improved the Pomodoro Timer which users can reset, start and stop the timer. In the timer, users can add a new task and set its completion time like customise break time. Also, this function has default times which are 25 mins on, 5 mins off (x4) then 30 mins break.
### Task
![Prototype(left) and Mockup(right)](/Img/Task.png)
>On the task page users can see the tasks they need to complete and all the details through Covey Quadrants, and the web app will show the task by priority rating.
### Message
![Message page](/Img/Message.png)
>In order to better fit the problems that users may encounter summarized in persona, I add a new web page in the design. On this page, users can send messages, share files, voice and video calls.
## Mobile
>In order to match the design with the web version, the mobile vision is also changed. The overall functions are same as the web vision the only change is in the layout which can make users more comfortable on their phones.

## Plug-in
>During the coding, I used plug-ins for pop-up windows and message input boxes, so there may be some differences between the real web app effect and the prototype.
